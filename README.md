💬 ChatBot in C

A simple terminal-based chatbot implemented in the C programming language.  
It can respond to greetings, ask for your name, tell jokes, and more — all through basic string matching.

---

 🚀 Features

- Handles greetings like `hello`, `hi`, etc.
- Responds to common phrases like "how are you", "what's your name"
- Can ask and remember your name temporarily
- Provides fun responses like jokes or facts
- Recognizes simple goodbye phrases to exit
- Converts input to lowercase for better matching

---

 🛠️ How It Works

- Uses `fgets()` to take input from the user.
- Applies `strstr()` for keyword-based matching.
- Maintains a flag to track conversational state (e.g., asking for name).
- Demonstrates simple string manipulation without external libraries.
